# Ideas on how to make this app


## Idea #1: JavaScript Objects

Create javascript objects that have different properties
* Each object will be a number
* One property will include the note
* Other properties can include the list its a part of, the colour of the note, whether the point has been completed etc

### Pros
* Since it's all code, it will be easier to access things, since you don't have to communicate between different types of files, languages etc
* I know javascript sort of already
* We can call different methods for each property

### Cons
* Naming conventions will be whack
* It's gonna be tricky keeping track of all the properties
* If I have alot of note, it might get hard to read
* Other than when the info is displayed, it will be really ugly to sift through the data and see how it looks 

## Idea #2: Database
